# Chrome DevTools Autosave

Chrome DevTools let you edit CSS and JavaScript. It even allow you to [save it](http://youtu.be/N8SS-rUEZPg?t=7m13s). You know it, right? I think, it's annoying to "Save as..." every time you want to save. Chrome DevTools Autosave saves files after every change for you!

## How Does It Work?

Chrome 16+ (dev channel) has a [onResourceContentCommitted event](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/dev/experimental.devtools.inspectedWindow.html#event-onResourceContentCommitted) that fires when you edit CSS and JavaScript.

    chrome.experimental.devtools.inspectedWindow.onResourceContentCommitted.addListener(function(event) {
        event.url
        event.type // 'script', 'stylesheet' or 'document' (happens when you add new CSS rule)
        event.getContent(function(content) {
            content // all the content of updated file as a string
        })
    })

Nice, isn't it?

Chrome DevTools Autosave sends the new content of the edited file to the server using `PUT` method. There are couple custom headers: `X-URL` and `X-Type` (I hope they are pretty much self-explanatory).

On the server I can find a file location by URL. I've made [a simple server using Node.js](/NV/chrome-devtools-autosave-server) that works only for `file://` scheme. It's â‰ˆ20LOC. You could write your own for your favorite web framework (Rails, Django, Express...). Go ahead!


## How to Install

Chrome DevTools Autosave consists of a Chrome extension and a server. The extension pushes changed files to the server. The server resolves URL of these files and overwrites the old ones with the new ones.

Open chrome://flags/ and enable Experimental Extension APIs  
Restart the browser  
Open chrome://extensions/  
Check "Developer mode"

    git clone https://github.com/NV/chrome-devtools-autosave.git

Choose "chrome-devtools-autosave/chrome" directory

### Install the Server

    git clone https://github.com/NV/chrome-devtools-autosave-server.git
    node chrome-devtools-autosave-server/index.js

### Configure Server Address

Open chrome://extensions/  
Open DevTools Autosave's options.  
Change "Post to" URL if needed.


## How to Use

    node chrome-devtools-autosave-server/index.js

Open example/index.html locally (using file:// scheme).  
Edit some CSS and JS.  
That's it. Files have been saved.
